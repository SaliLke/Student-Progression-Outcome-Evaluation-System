# Student-Progression-Outcome-Evaluation-System (Python)
I developed this program to predict progression outcomes of students at the end of each academic year.The 
user should choose his role as student or staff-member, students can only check their progress once but staff members can check multiple student records and the histogram will generate the input records.

The program promts for the number of credits at pass, defer and fail and then display the appropriate progression outcome for an individual student (i.e., progress, trailing, module retriever or exclude). The program displays ‘Integer required’ if a credit input is the wrong data type and displays ‘Out of range’ if credits entered are not in the range 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120. Also the program displays ‘Total incorrect’ if the total of the pass, defer and fail credits is not 120. 

The program loops to allow a staff member to predict progression outcomes for multiple students.The program prompts for credits at pass, defer and fail and display the appropriate progression for each individual student until the staff member enters ‘q’ to quit. Opyionally you can use an input of ‘y’ to continue.When ‘q’ is entered, the program produces a ‘histogram’ representing the number of students who achieved a progress outcome in each category range and the total number of students. 

Part 2
The program saves the input progression data to a list or nested list then access the stored data from the list and print them.

Part 3
The program saves any inpuƩed progression data to a text file.Then access the stored data and print them.
